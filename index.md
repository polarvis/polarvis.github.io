# About the project

PolarVis studies how, why and with what consequences networked visual persuasion becomes a mechanism of integration and polarisation in digitally saturated societies. 

Images feed into a powerful form of political communication that forges affective and political (dis)connection with transnational resonance. Political actors have long used visual repertoires to frame issues, mobilise support, and build (or undermine) legitimacy. In this time of high mediatisation and growing turmoil, citizens, journalists, and platforms play a part by also generating, modifying, and amplifying the repertoires. It is under these conditions that our narratives about ourselves, others, and the key issues facing our societies now play out. Until recently, however, it has not been possible to get analytical traction on networked visual persuasion at large scale.

   * The  project studies networked visual persuasion in and around climate movements in Europe. The design focuses key junctures in the social and algorithmic negotiation around images to understand their role as content, their affective resonance, and the processes of connection and conflict that occur around them.

   * The project brings together a cross-disciplinary [team](https://polarvis.github.io/people/) of researchers in the social and computer sciences based at institutions across Europe. The team includes the Hungarian Academy of Science, the IT University of Copenhagen, University of Copenhagen, University of Vienna, and Uppsala University.

PolarVis is funded within the framework of [CHANSE Collaboration of Humanities and Social Sciences in Europe](https://chanse.org/), with co-funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.
