# About the project

Blah blah blah

To add a new page, add the file with the page content to `_pages/` (some examples already there) and update `_data/navigation.yml` to make it appear in the top menu.

General page content such as the logo, the links to social media at the bottom, etc. can be specified in the file `config.yml`.

Images are kept in directory `_assets/`.
