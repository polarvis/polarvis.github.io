## The PolarVis Social Media Dashboard 


A key contribution of the PolarVis research project is the development and design of a Social Media Dashboard to compare different visual climate communication strategies. The dashboard is an interactive tool that empowers website visitors to explore data on social media posts. It enables users to understand the impact of posts on audiences, evaluate the performance of specific posts over time, and compare communication strategies used by various climate change actors.

The PolarVis Social Media Dashboard is currently under development and will be available here soon!
