## Explore Our Dashboards

How do images shape public debate—and how can we better understand their persuasive power online?

As part of the PolarVis project, we created three interactive dashboards that offer different windows into the visual politics of climate communication on social media. Drawing on research across Europe, the dashboards allow users to explore how images are used to engage, persuade, and polarise in digital spaces.

Whether you're a researcher, communicator, or simply curious about online debates, these tools invite you to explore patterns of visual messaging, emotional responses, and evolving communication strategies. Developed through a collaborative, co-design process, they are meant to support reflection, comparison, and more informed engagement in a changing media landscape.

    Social Media Dashboard – Explore overall patterns in visual climate communication.

    Polarisation Dashboard – Compare emotional dynamics and visual content across countries.

    Workshop Dashboard – Dive into examples and findings from our local co-design workshop.

## The PolarVis Polarisation Dashboard

<br />

This interactive dashboard visualizes and analyzes social media dynamics related to climate change messages featuring visual content, published in the lead-up to the 2021 German federal election. It explores a dataset of approximately 84,000 social media posts from Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, each containing at least one image.The dashboard was developed by* Tobias Raidl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-raidl/) as part of the Interdisciplinary Project in Data Science (TU Wien), during which he collaborated with the PolarVis team at the University of Vienna to interpret the key analytical goals of the PolarVis project and create a dashboard that allows users to explore and analyze the data in the most effective way for the intended purposes.

A primary objective of the visualization is to identify instances of image-sharing polarization, where images are shared exclusively within partisan communities. This functionality is achieved through a component of the dashboard consisting of a large network graph, where nodes represent social media accounts. Two accounts are connected if they shared at least one identical image during the six-week period leading up to the election. In addition to a filter option, the graph visualization includes the following interactive features: clicking on a node reveals more information about the corresponding account, while clicking on a connection displays the images shared by both accounts.

The dashboard also allows identifying instances of image-sharing across partisan lines, where accounts associated with different political parties shared identical images.

## The PolarVis Workshop Dashboard

A key contribution of the PolarVis research project is the development and design of a Social Media Dashboard to compare different visual climate communication strategies. The dashboard is an interactive tool that empowers website visitors to explore data on social media posts. It enables users to understand the impact of posts on audiences, evaluate the performance of specific posts over time, and compare communication strategies used by various climate change actors.
