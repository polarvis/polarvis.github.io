In this episode, we welcome Andreas Szeles, head of communication at ⁠Greenpeace Hungary.⁠ He specializes in communication strategies for a socially just transition to an environmentally sustainable future using social media channels such as ⁠Facebook⁠, TikTok, ⁠YouTube⁠ and ⁠Instagram⁠. In the episode, he gives an insight into how audiences can be reached, how climate actors sometimes need to employ humor and memes, and how important this outreach is for the work of environmental organisations. The episode is hosted by Dániel Mikecz, senior research fellow at the Center for Social Sciences in Budapest.
