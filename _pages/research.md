# Visual Persuasion in a Transforming Europe 

PolarVis aims to understand how, why and with what consequences visual content becomes a mechanism of integration and polarisation in digitally saturated societies. It draws on in-depth qualitative approaches and large-scale computational analysis, providing unique interdisciplinary traction on the challenges of theorising and studying networked visual persuasion and its political role. The project studies movements and countermovements around the intergenerational issue of climate change, and focuses on four key junctures in (trans)national processes of persuasion and polarisation.

#### PRODUCTION

PolarVis uses interviews to understand the visual communication strategies of climate movement actors and stakeholders and address the following types of questions: How do (counter)movements use visual communication on digital platforms as part of their communication repertoire to mobilise, engage, and generate narratives about themselves and others?  

Selected actvities:

- Stakeholder Workshop on Polarized Perspectives, 11 March 2024 HUN-REN Budapest, Hungary.
- Conference Presentation. D. Oross, D. Mikecz, and D. Rákos ‘The visual communication of climate change in a shifting political environment,’ Hungarian Political Science Association, 16-17 May 2024, Pécs, Hungary.
- Conference Presentation. D. Mikecz, D. Oross and D. Rákos ‘Images as means of cohesion and polarization in Hungary.’ Alternative Futures and Popular Protest Conference, 17-18 June 2024, Manchester, UK.




#### PICTURES

What are the characteristics of the persuasive, contentious, and polarising visual content shared by (counter)movements? How is it framed? What visual narratives emerge?


#### PUBLICS

What kind of public (re)action is observable around the visual content that movements and countermovements share online? How is this connected with the emergence of affective publics and antagonising counterpublics?


#### PROPAGATION

How does this visual content spread online, and allow like-minded or opposed groups to emerge? <br />
What is the trajectory of narratives and repertoires across groups, platforms and time?
