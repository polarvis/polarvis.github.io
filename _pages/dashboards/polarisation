The dashboard was developed by 
**[Tobias Raidl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-raidl/)**  
as part of the Interdisciplinary Project in Data Science (TU Wien), during which he collaborated with the PolarVis team at the University of Vienna to interpret the key analytical goals of the PolarVis project and create a dashboard that allows users to explore and analyze the data in the most effective way for the intended purposes.

A primary objective of the visualization is to identify instances of image-sharing polarization, where images are shared exclusively within partisan communities. This functionality is achieved through a component of the dashboard consisting of a large network graph, where nodes represent social media accounts. Two accounts are connected if they shared at least one identical image during the six-week period leading up to the election. In addition to a filter option, the graph visualization includes the following interactive features: clicking on a node reveals more information about the corresponding account, while clicking on a connection displays the images shared by both accounts.

The dashboard also allows identifying instances of image-sharing across partisan lines, where accounts associated with different political parties shared identical images.
